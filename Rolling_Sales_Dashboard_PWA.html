Something to the effect of they changed the spec a bit and activated a \u201cmatch pricing\u201d clause that was in place with Makino to make this happen. Best I can tell it sounds as if the spec was changed to suit that of the last Makino\u2019s they purchased several years ago, and that old pricing was honored as well.

Lead engineer, Bob Falkenberry, is heading up and advises we should have official RFP in our hands as soon as it clears their procurement stream. Bob also invited in on an upcoming project to replace all their aging G&L machines, more to come here. Touched base with Jesse Agnew, lead for our existing housing cell/Fastem systems line and all but confirmed that we should have PO in hand for new copy and paste machine addition to this line in January 2026. This would be an HU63, will relay our ROM for this this week. Lastly, were pleased to be invited in on another project in their \u201cflight control systems\u201d area to bid on 2 replacement machines for their existing and worn our current equipment. Although they are currently using horizontals we think may be opportunity to present alternate way to attack these parts via multiple Vertex\u2019s but can also stay horizontal in our approach if they are hard set on that, early yet. Jesse is lead on this project as well and advised he has added us to the RFP invite list and when it\u2019s thru their purchasing team we will get shot at this one as well."}, {"date": "2025-07-26", "stage": "Booked / PO", "owner": "Yuho", "summary": "With support from Yuho was able to complete the quote for the HU63 housing line expansion project here and submit to Boeing.
